In this project we built the board game Othello that is playable in the browser. There were no server-side component- we used client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

The goals for this project were to:

* Use client-side to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side applicaiton

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
